# BigData_Project
This research aims to seek the capabilities of big data analysis and machine learning. Using Scala Spark, we constructed a predictive model tailored to hotel ratings coming from customer reviews. The dataset we are using ranges from a wide array of hotels, with ratings going from 1-5 across many different factors. These factors: service quality, cleanliness, overall experience, and many more variables. Through the use of machine learning algorithms such as decision tree classification. The study will aim to discover intricate patterns and important insights within the dataset. By analyzing diverse factors that can actually distinguish between a hotelâ€™s promoted rating versus actual ratings from customers, it will offer a stronger understanding of guest preferences and satisfaction ratings.
